Instructionns to run the k-means.py :
1) Place the input file which contains the dataset in the same folder as k-means.py
2) Open k-means.py code in the Syder IDE
3) In Line number 219 of the code, assign the name of the input file to the variable inputfile
             Ex : inputfile = "cho.txt"
4) In Line number 222 of the code, assign the variable "k" , its value.
             Ex: k=5
5) In Line number 231 of the code, specify the data point numbers to the variable "dp". They serve as initial centroids.
             Ex:  dp= [5,25,32,100,125]
6) In the Ipython console, on running the code , it outputs the scatter plot, jaccard cofficient and rand index.
